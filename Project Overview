Project Overview:

DevStations is a full-stack web application built to demonstrate end-to-end development using a React frontend and a Python (Flask) backend. It is designed as a production-ready MVP, showing modern development practices including RESTful APIs, cloud deployment, and modular architecture.

The project serves as a learning and reference tool for developers who want to understand:

How to structure a full-stack web application with clean frontend-backend separation.

How to build and consume REST APIs with Python Flask.

How to deploy both frontend and backend to cloud environments like GCP Cloud Run or GitHub Pages.

How to implement CRUD operations, CORS handling, and multi-environment deployment.

Best practices for scalable, maintainable, and modular code.

Key goals:

Demonstrate a realistic full-stack workflow from local development to cloud deployment.

Provide a reference implementation for new developers learning React, Flask, or cloud deployment.

Serve as a portfolio project that highlights skills in frontend, backend, cloud, and API development.

Target audience:

Junior to mid-level developers looking to understand full-stack web app architecture.

Open-source contributors interested in React + Flask projects.

💡 Tip: You can also include one sentence about what’s live, like:
