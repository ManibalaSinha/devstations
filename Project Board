##  How to Add Issues to the Board

1. Go to **Projects → New Project → Board (Kanban)**
2. Name it: `DevStations Roadmap` or `DevStations Volunteer Tasks`
3. Add the **columns** above
4. Use **“Add cards” → Issues** to link your existing issues to the board
5. Volunteers can **drag issues** from To Do → In Progress → Done as they work

> Tip: You can also **filter cards by labels** (`good first issue`, `help wanted`) for easy sorting.

---

##  Optional Enhancements

* Use **milestones** if you want to group issues into sprints or feature sets
* Add **priority labels** (`high`, `medium`, `low`) so volunteers know what’s urgent
* Add **notes/cards** for “Ideas” or “Future Features”
